## Description

> Full-Stack application using the MERN stack

## Introduction 

Have you ever pulled out an old lego set and started to follow each instruction to recreate this nostaligic piece of art, only to find out you are missing a couple of pieces and you can no longer finish it with out these crucial little pieces. Thanks to StickleBricks that problem can be easily solved. 

I, along with a few other school cohort members developed StickleBricks. The online E-commerce store selling individual lego pieces, or full sets as well. 

Taking information from the BrickLink API we created this app from the ground up taking a whack at our first e-commerce site using a full stack. 

### Site Features:

- Login / Signup
- Shop page to view all the items in the store
- Search with the ability to perform a raw search or search by     given parameters within Category, Color, or Part Type
- When you're viewing the items you are able to click on an item to view it larger and from there the ability to change the quantity and the ability to Add to Cart
- Once you're in the cart you're able to remove items you dont want.

### Future Implementaions 

- Admin Login with functionality specific to the admin only
- Account page to be able to view account info and change account information.
- Checkout / Create Order to be able to actually process these orders. Given the api that we were using, it did restrict us with the payment method. It did require all payments to be processed through actual BrickLink (the api being used.)
